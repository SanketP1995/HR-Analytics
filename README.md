# HR-Analytics
The project aimed to build a supervised learning model to identify eligible  candidate for promotion at some checkpoint to expedite the promotion  cycle which would reduce the time of employees to transit into new role. 
Objective:
•	  The project aimed to build a machine learning model wherein HR department could predict the employees who are most likely to get promoted. The transition to new roles usually causes delay which can be reduced if HR department is able to know the probable promoted employees and they can make transition easy.
Solution:
•	Performed EDA using different libraries, gained insights from data and selected important features accordingly. Build a prediction model using classification algorithms, checked the model performance using performance matrix.
Algorithm used:
•	Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest Classifier
